```

## Create Web

### ui.Rmd

This Rmd works as a webpage builder. Its frontmatter:

```
dependencies: "dependencies" # the html dependencies name, better called dependencies if want to bring it forward to shiny app building
output:
  html_tag:   
    filename: "index.html" # webpage html name
    dirpath: "`r library(econR); . %//% 'docs'`" # webpage folder
    object: "ui" # the object that will be rendered into webpage.
```

Addins > Create Web

will create webpage as defined

## Build App

_shiny.yml defines app file system.

```
dependencies: 'shiny' # shiny or dependencies
appPath: "where you want your app sits in"
supporting_dir: "where your server.Rmd supporting files sit in"
```

## ui.Rmd

Check if your shiny functions for input and output are properly used:

  * `xxxInput`
  
  * `output_outputId` 
  
Addins > Build App

## server.Rmd

Check if your inputs and outputs are used with consistent ids, and all outputs have proper render function defined:

  * `input_inputId`
  
  * `output_outputId` with `render_outputId`

Build > App
